chatbot is slow
chatbot is struggling to understand ambiguous statement
chatbot is to simplistic and unable to simple santances
dataset is small
system computational's is lacking
chatbot gives personal data


## unstructured data
structured data 

| structured data                     | unstructured                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| fits neatly into a database         | lacks a a clear structure           |
| easy to retrive                     | needs special tools to be useful    |
| enable quick decision-making        | takes longer to analize             |
| can be used in spreadsheets and sql | requires advanced tools like NLP/ML |
| quantitative insights               | qualitative insights                |
one way to overcome dependencies is to transfrom unstructured text into machine-actionable
natural language understanding (NLU) is a pipeline created through many machine learning models that carry out different functions

Training a chatbot is another step towards improving a chatbot’s ability to understand text.

To reduce response time, the training dataset needs to be large, accurate, classified, readable,
domain specific and relevant

Lexical analysis - like a dictionary

Syntactic analysis -  parse the sentance -> 


1. Lexical analysis: The input text is broken down into words and sentences; for example,
\[“I”, “want”, “to”, “make”, “a”, “claim”, “about”, “a”, “car”, “accident”].
2. Syntactic analysis (parsing): Interpreting the grammar and structure of the sentence;
for example, that “I” is the subject of the sentence, “want” is the verb, and “claim” is
the object (see Figure 2).
3. Semantic analysis: Analysing the meaning of the sentence and its individual words;
for example, the sentence is about the customer’s desire to make a claim related to a
car accident.
4. Discourse integration: Integrating the meaning of the sentence with the larger context of
the conversation; for example, understanding that the user is a customer who would like to
enquire about a claim.
5. Pragmatic analysis: Analysing the social, legal, and cultural context of the sentence;
for example, understanding that the customer is a car driver who has had an accident
and may or may not be hurt or have damaged the vehicle.
