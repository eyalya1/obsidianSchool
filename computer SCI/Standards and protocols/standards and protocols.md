## standards
standards are **agreements** about hardware or software and designed to facilitate the interoperablity and compatibility

open standards are free( as in beer) and anyone can use them and implement in different ways ex. USB and PDF

closed standards are proprietary and can only implement by people who hold a s licence.
ex. docx(ms word),mp3, hdmi(hardware)

## protocols

protocols are internationally agreed set of rules to ensure transfer of data between devices and programs.

#### advantages of protocols 
data integrety some protocols can detect packet loss and request a lost packet be resent

Flow control: on host on a network might be able to send data much faster than another on can receive it. Some protocols can establish a common data transmission speed between between hosts to avoid problems

Deadlock -> this occurs when all hosts are waiting to receive data before they can continue sending. hence nothing happens, and they just sit there waiting. Some have timers

Congestion -> some protocols can detect network congestion and reduce their data transmission rate to protect the network from collapse

error checking 

### Network Security
the 3 factors of security: 
>something you know(example: username and password)
>something you are(fingerprint)
>something you have (phone for sms 2fa)

access control -> read write execute

encryption
Antivirus
Backup
firewall
physical measures(doors to protect sever farms)
