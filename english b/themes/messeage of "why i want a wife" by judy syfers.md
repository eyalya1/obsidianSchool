The extract from "*why i want a wife*"/Judy Syfers wants to pass a message of the absurdity of the patriarchal system that Judy lived in. It was written to celebrate the 50 year anniversary to women voting right in the us. It is trying to relay the absurdity of wanting a wife not as a partner but as someone who is beneath you, who will do everything for you.
The short story does not show husband in a light of love ,but of authority where the wife must do every task the husband does not want to do such as taking care of the children when they are sick, of the husband physical need. It also shows the unevenness of marriage where it is always the husband who choose the wife never the other way around.
The different types of sacrifice where the husband cannot waste any time doing something he does not want, where the wife must comply and i the husband requires "it" may have to lose "its" job.
The constant repetition of the phrase "i want a wife" where the husband never talk about admiration but for him, no sacrifice but for him, no love but for him shows the real meaning of "wife".
In conclusion the exert talks about many different parts of the coldness of patriarchy, and shows the treatment of almost "inhuman" wife
